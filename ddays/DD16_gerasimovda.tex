% Text:

Quantum graph is a widely used model of nanosystem [1-4] TODO. If the graph $\Gamma$ consists of finite number of edges and all edges have finite lengths then the Hamiltonian has purely discrete spectrum. The system of eigenfunctions is complete in $L_2(\Gamma)$. If the graph contains semi-infinite edges, one has non-empty continuous spectrum and resonances generated by the eigenvalues of the initial Hamiltonian of finite graph. For many applications, it is important to know a space in which the resonant states form a complete system. In the present paper we determine this space for a graph with two infinite leads and one loop using Sz.-Nagy model [5].

Due to the symmetry of the problem, scattering matrix $S$ takes the form TODO MATRIX, and solving the system of equations, we obtain:
\[
\det S = \frac{((a^2 - 5k^2) \cos(kd) \sin(kd) -4ak \sin^2(kd) + 2ak) + i (2ak \cos(kd) \sin(kd) -4k^2 \sin^2(kd) + 2k^2)}{((a^2 - 5k^2) \cos(kd) \sin(kd) -4ak \sin^2(kd) + 2ak) - i (2ak \cos(kd) \sin(kd) -4k^2 \sin^2(kd) + 2k^2)}
\]

We establish the completeness of the resonant states in the space of square integrable functions on the ring. To show this, we have to prove that $S$ is a Blaschke-Potapov product [6], that is,

\[
\lim\limits_{r \to 1 - 0} \int\limits_{L_r} \log  \abs{\det S(z)} \frac{dz}{(z - 1)^2} = 0 ,
\]

where $L_r$ is the image of the curve $\abs{\xi} = r$ ($r < 1$) under the map $z = i \frac{1 + \xi}{1 - \xi}$. Substituting $\det S$, which we calculated above, and estimating the integral, one obtains the desired result.
